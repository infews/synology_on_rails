# Synology on Rails Support Files

These are the key files that I wound up with while figuring out how to deploy and run a Rails app on my Synology NAS.

The blog posts describing the journey are [here](https://dwf.bigpencil.net/rails-docker-nas/).

Your mileage _will most certainly_ vary. But this worked for me.

## Assumptions & Dependencies

- Rails 7.1 app
- Synology NAS with DSM 7.2+

My Gemfile and other support files are not included. So please use these all for inspiration.
